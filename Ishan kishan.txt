Whether it be his four consecutive sixes at the Eden Gardens in 2019, 
his stunning 99 in Dubai in 2020, his dancing reels, or that moment 
when he froze in front of the great Sachin Tendulkar, Ishan Kishan is 
the perfect entertainer, on and off the ground.

India’s under-19 skipper in 2016, he was first signed up by the 
Gujarat Lions, where he impressed immediately with 277 runs at a strike 
rate of 134.46 in the 2017 season. A keeper-batter, we snapped him up 
in 2018 as a 19-year-old, and in the 2020 season - with 516 runs at an 
average of 57.33 - was crucial in our 2020 title triumph. In 2022, he 
became the most expensive buy at the mega auction. Who else but us?

True to his explosive style, he smashed the first ball he faced in T20I 
cricket for a four and the first ball in ODI cricket for a six. And now, 
with the IPL 2024 on the horizon, we can’t wait to see Ishan set the 
field ablaze with his tenacity, hawkeye dismissal ability behind the 
stumps, and that adrenaline rush that makes him the power-packed 
entertainer he is.

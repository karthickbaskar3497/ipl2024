Attention, please! The train arriving on Platform 1 is a fast train bound for Wankhede Stadium. The train name is Boom Boom Bumrah.

A trademark run-up and a slanted-arm load-up already had Jasprit Bumrah standing out. But the actual exhibition of his talent came in the 2013 IPL, impressing immediately on debut, with a 3/32 on debut against RCB and the wickets of Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers in his kitty.

He has been with MI from the start, and he has grown quickly to become the leader of the Indian pace attack. His spells in the 2017 (2/26 vs RPSG) and 2019 finals (2/14 vs CSK) won not only the hearts of the Paltan but showed just why he is a player who loves pressure.

We missed him in the 2023 edition, but a dream run of form leading up to the 2024 season in all formats has gotten us all excited to see the trademark run-up, the trademark uprooting of stumps, and the trademark pumped-up celebrations!

No total’s ever safe; no boundary is ever too big, and no bowler 
is to be pardoned when Tim David’s in the mood. He’s a proper 
monster with a bat; ask our MI Paltan!

Singapore-born, Australia-raised Tim is the son of former 
Singapore seamer Rod David. His clean ball-striking capabilities 
first came to the fore in the 2017-18 season of the Big Bash 
League. A call to represent the Singapore national side soon 
followed, and he emerged as the leading run-scorer with 369 runs 
in five matches in the World Cup Challenge List A tournament.

Over the next couple of years, he travelled around the globe and 
became one of the most in-demand players in franchise cricket. 
The 2022 season saw some exceptionally quick cameos in the death
 overs for the Mumbai Indians in the IPL, and he finished with 
 186 runs in just 8 games. From there onwards, it was a steady 
 climb up the ladder — T20I debut for Australia in 2022 and ODI 
 debut in 2023.

In addition to the Mumbai Indians, the 6 feet 5 inches man has 
also donned the Blue and Gold for our sister teams: 
MI Cape Town (2023), MI New York (2023), and MI Emirates (2024). W
ith long levers to fetch and send the ball into orbit, as witnessed 
in his unbeaten 45 off 14 balls against RR in 2023, Tim David is a
ll geared up to torment opposition batters in the latest campaign.

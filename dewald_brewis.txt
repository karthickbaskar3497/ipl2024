The ‘Butter Chicken’ loving Dewald Brevis joined us in 2022 following his record exploits of 506 runs at the Under-19 World Cup. More than the runs, it was his style that had everybody take notice. In fact, his no-look six over long-on has a separate fan base, ask Suryakumar Yadav.

Brevis’ ball-striking powers were seen for MI last season with a 19-ball 29 on debut against KKR and a 25-ball 49 against PBKS (4x4s,5x6s). Well, that was just the trailer. In a CSA T20 game later that year, he did this: 162 runs | 57 balls | 13 fours | 13 sixes. In a CPL game, he smashed 30 runs in an over. Again, we’ve barely scratched the surface.

He’s walking in on the back of some stellar knocks in the MLC to take MI New York to the title. The movie is loading. Expect DB to come into his own and deliver a box office hit in IPL 2024.

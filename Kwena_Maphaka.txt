South Africa’s 17-year-old Kwena Maphaka shot into the limelight at the U19 World Cup earlier this year where he was awarded the Player of the Tournament for picking 21 wickets. The left armer’s 21 wickets are the most ever by a pace bowler in an edition of the U19 World Cup.

He spearheaded South Africa’s attack as they made the semi-finals in home conditions. The 17-year old has already represented South Africa A and South Africa Emerging teams. He will share the dressing room with two of the best bowlers in world cricket – Lasith Malinga, Bowling Coach and Jasprit Bumrah putting him on a path of learning, development and building on that knowledge.

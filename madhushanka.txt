Pace, swing, left-arm. The perfect combo for the Wankhede is here. Remember the India-Sri Lanka contest in Mumbai from the World Cup this year? Remember his fifer? Rohit, Gill, Kohli, Iyer, SKY were foxed! A Sri Lankan pacer in the Blue and Gold, under the tutelage of Lasith Malinga, need we really say more?


But hey, his penchant for a five-wicket haul dates back to 2020, when he grabbed 5/38 in the U-19 World Cup Plate quarter-final against Nigeria. Blessed with the ability to swing the ball in the powerplay, Madushanka has turned his early soft-ball cricket experiences into a career of hope and success with the leather ball in international cricket today.


The Sri Lankan pacer, unfortunately, picked up a hamstring injury ahead of IPL 2024 and thus has been ruled out of the tournament.

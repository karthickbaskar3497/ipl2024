Fidget spinners might be a craze, but Piyush Chawla has that magic in his fingers. Heâ€™s our wily old fox.

He is not your ordinary leggie, mixing his leg-breaks, googlies, top-spinners and his 125+ kph quicker deliveries. This process has seen him become one of the highest wicket-taking spinners of all time in the IPL. His international career resume might not have too many games, but there are plenty of moments that stand out since his debut at 17, including him bamboozling Kevin Pietersen with a googly and of course, winning the 2011 World Cup.

A two-time IPL winner, PC enjoyed his best league campaign with us in 2023 (22 wickets in 16 games) and is set to be the one to pioneer the spin department in IPL 2024

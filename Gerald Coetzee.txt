Need pace? He’s got it. Need aggression? He’s got it. Need a pumped up celebration? He’s got it in abundance. He’s Gerald Coetzee, and he is set to get the opposition quivering with his young, exciting, raw bowling spells.


Just as he clocks his deliveries with speeds over 145kmph, Coetzee’s career graph has been an upward trend - joining South Africa’s U-19 team at 16, playing two U-19 World Cups (2018, 2020) and getting a senior call-up for the Proteas in 2022. What followed was a dream debut season where he emerged as a star at the 2023 World Cup with a whopping 20 wickets in the tournament, and we cannot wait to see him send down thunderbolts at the Wankhede!

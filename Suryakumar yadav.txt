They say the sky's the limit, but for SKY, there really is no limit. 
Say hello to the ICC T20I Cricketer of the Year, 2022.

In the last few years, he has truly rewritten the white-ball batting 
book with his there’s-no-way-you-could-have-played-that shots. A 
Chembur lad, he fine-tuned his skills with the bat while playing 
for local clubs (Parsi Gymkhana, Dadar Union) before jumping 
onto the IPL bandwagon.

He started at MI in 2011 and even played a key role in us winning 
the Champions League T20 that year. He moved to the Kolkata Knight 
Riders in 2014, establishing himself as a finisher in the side.

In 2018, we brought our prodigal son back home, and since then, 
the chants of ‘Aapla Dada Surya’ have never stopped. Moving to the 
top of the batting order, 300-plus runs in every IPL season since 
then meant SKY would now be an indispensable team member. 
His ‘Main hoon na’ celebration on sealing a nerve-wracking chase 
against RCB with a stunning 79*(43) is etched in gold.

A two-time ICC T20I Player of the Year (2022, 2023), Aapla Dada Surya, 
is now all set to write a new chapter not just in his legacy as an MI 
star but also as one of the batting stalwarts for the franchise in IPL 2024

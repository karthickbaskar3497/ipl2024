About Hardik
The complete modern-day cricketer. The new-age legend. Our skip!


Hardik Pandya, the true-blue Mumbai Indians icon, is back in the Blue and Gold. For seven years from 2015-2021, he formed the core of the MI winning juggernaut. And he did everything for the team â€“ opening the bowling, bowling at the death, batting when the asking rates were touching the sky, batting when the ship needed anchoring, forming a fortress at long-on. He was calm, always up for a fight, and loved the big stage.


He announced himself on the big stage in his first season itself, when against CSK, he walked in to bat with MI needing 30 to win off the last two overs. With three sixes in four balls and a knock of 21*(8), from the jaws of defeat, he saw us home. And then did the same for the next seven years.


He is coming back home after two years, more decorated, more celebrated, more revered.

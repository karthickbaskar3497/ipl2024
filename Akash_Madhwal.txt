The Roorkee-born pacer, who made his T20 debut against Karnataka in 2019, was initially signed as a replacement for the injured Suryakumar Yadav in IPL 2022.

Leading Uttarakhandâ€™s pace attack in the domestic circuit, he impressed with his ability to shoulder the responsibility of a young bowling lineup, bowling the tough overs in the T20 game. Case in point: The final over of the DY Patil Trophy 2023 to win Reliance 1 the title in a heart-stopping finale, where he defended two runs in four balls.

IPL 2023 saw him amass 14 wickets - including THAT record-breaking 5/5 against Lucknow in the Eliminator. If nothing, Madhwal will be raring to steamroll all opposition batters in IPL 2024 with the same energy, the same hunger for wickets and the same mentality to win games for MI.

Well, it won’t be an exaggeration to say that Tilak Varma has
 been one of the most promising young talents to have come up 
 in Indian cricket over the last few years, and IPL 2022 had 
 a massive role to play in that.

Fresh from winning the under-19 World Cup, the southpaw took

and the experience of captaining Hyderabad to win the 2024 
Ranji Trophy Plate division, TV — as we fondly call him — 
is simply one player worthy of being a gamechanger in the 
middle order in the upcoming campaign

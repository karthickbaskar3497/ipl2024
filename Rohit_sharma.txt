Our captain. Our Hitman. Our record-breaker.

Let’s just list his achievements, shall we?


* Four T20I centuries - the only batter to hold this record
* Three ODI double-centuries - the only batter to hold this record
* Five hundreds in one World Cup edition (2019) - the only batter to hold this record
* Six IPL trophies (Five with MI, one with Deccan Chargers) - the most by any player

One of Aamchi Mumbai’s favourite sons, Rohit Sharma, sprung into focus during the 
inaugural World T20 in 2007, playing a massive role in India winning the trophy. 
The Deccan Chargers then picked him up, before we snapped him up at the 2011 mega 
auctions, and thereafter never let him go!

What followed was carnage with the bat, turning him into a modern-day 
great and winning title after title in the IPL. Thirteen years after 
his debut in the Blue and Gold, we cannot wait to see ‘The Hitman Show’ 
all across the country in IPL 2024
